pyhash is a python non-cryptographic hash library.

It provide several common hash algorithms with C/C++ implementation for performance.

pyhash support the following hash algorithms

FNV (Fowler-Noll-Vo) hash
    fnv1_32
    fnv1a_32
    fnv1_64
    fnv1a_64
MurmurHash 2.0
    murmur2_32
    murmur2a_32
    murmur2_aligned_32
    murmur2_neutral_32
    murmur2_64
lookup3
    lookup3 # base on sys.byteorder
    lookup3_little
    lookup3_big
SuperFastHash
    super_fast_hash
